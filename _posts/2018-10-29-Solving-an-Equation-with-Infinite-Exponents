This is a tricky problem that often appears in technical interviews.

*Problem*: If x^x^x^x^x^x^x^x^x^x^x...... = 2, solve for x.

*Solution*:

This problem has an obvious recursive structure. We can rewrite the problem as

$$
x^2=2
$$

Then $x=\sqrt{2}$.

The interview will often go further. What if x^x^x^x^x^x^x^x^x^x^x...... = 4? Applying the same technique,

$$
x^4=4
$$

Again $x=\sqrt{2}$. How come it is the same as previous one?
